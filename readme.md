# Wood Identification

The project goal is to use machine learning to aid in the identification of wood types.  The end-goal is a program that will isolate the wood types to a max of three varieties, and provide tools (perhaps further machine learning algorithms) to narrow down the selection.  Identification begins with pictures of the end- grain of the lumber in question.

### Test or Selection Group

I started with a relatively small test group of five hardwoods woods.  Hardwoods generally have more distinct early wood vs. late-wood rings

Pictures were taken with a variety of cameras, but to achieve consistent results with what user will take pictures with, an iPhone was used with picture taken from 8" away.

> Ash - Hardwood, ring-porous
> - Similar to White Oak  
> - Very different Early and Late woods rings
> - Nearly invisible medullary rays

> Beach - Hardwood, diffuse-porous
> - My personal favorite woods
> - Tight grain configuration
> - Distinctive medullary rays

> Cherry - Hardwood, diffuse-porous  
> - Tighter grain structure
> - More difficult to identify from end-grain

> Red Oak - Hardwood, ring-porous
> - Distinct Early and Late wood rings
> - Very open Early wood structure
> - pronounced medullary rays

> White Oak
> - Similar to Red Oak, but early and late wood not as Distinct
> - Known for it's medullary rays, and thus often quarter-sawn
